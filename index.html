                />
                <p>
                  Walking around Madrid means coming across iconic spots such as
                  the stunning Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor with 400 years of
                  history, the buzzing Puerta del Sol, the famous Gran Vía full
                  of shops, or the four tallest towers in Spain.
                  <br />
                  Each neighbourhood offers a different experience: La Latina is
                  ideal for tapas, Las Letras has the perfect combination of
                  literature and fine dining… But Madrid also means relaxing in
                  enormous and charming green spaces such as the Retiro or El
                  Capricho parks.

                  <br />
                  At dusk, some of the city’s viewpoints will surprise you with
                  unique sunsets, at the Temple of Debod or the rooftop of the
                  Círculo de Bellas Artes, for example. At the end of the day
                  you can enjoy the legendary Madrid's nightlife with live music

                When it's time to eat, Madrid has many different options, each
                more appealing than the last. On the one hand, traditional bars
                where you can discover the old-fashioned, unpretentious
                atmosphere known as ‘castizo’, and why tapas are so much fun.
                <br />
                On the other hand, there are its cutting-edge restaurants like
                DiverXO and traditional markets that have been turned into new
                gourmet spaces, such as San Miguel, which has become a true
                gastronomic shrine. In Madrid, the time is always ripe to enjoy
                an animated, urban atmosphere. For example, the increasingly
                famous weekend brunches in enclosed glass terraces, courtyards,
                rooftops, etc.
